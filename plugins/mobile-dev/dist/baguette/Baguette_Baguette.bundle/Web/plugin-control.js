// PluginControl — what ticking a row in a plugin panel means.
//
// Before this, a plugin wanting a settings list wrote its state into the
// row title: display.py shipped `"● Light"` / `"○ Dark"`. That is a
// plugin drawing a control glyph inside a string, in a page whose whole
// premise is that the host owns every pixel. Escaping made it safe, not
// right — the host couldn't style it, a screen reader read a bullet, and
// "which one is on" was legible only to a human eye.
//
// So a row says whether it is on (`state`) and what it submits
// (`value`); the manifest says which glyph family draws it; and this
// file says what clicking does.
//
//   "body": { "kind": "list", "source": "perms",
//             "control": { "kind": "checkbox", "arg": "enabled",
//                          "submit": "Apply" } }
//
// Ticking is LOCAL and batched. It costs no subprocess: the panel
// accumulates ticks and posts them together when the submit button is
// pressed, as `{"args": {"enabled": ["camera", "mic"]}}`. The trade is
// that between the tick and the answer, a row shows state the device has
// not confirmed — so `pending` exists, and the host marks those rows
// rather than letting them look settled. A control that lies about the
// device is worse than one that's slow.
//
// Ticks are plain objects passed in and returned, never held here: the
// renderer owns the current set, this file only says what the next one
// should be. That keeps every decision testable without a DOM, the same
// arrangement plugin-row-action.js and plugin-prompt.js use.
