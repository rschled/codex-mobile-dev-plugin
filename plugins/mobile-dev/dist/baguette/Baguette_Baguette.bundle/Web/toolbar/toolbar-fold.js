// ToolbarFold — what the focus toolbar gives up when the row is too
// narrow, and in what order.
//
// The focus toolbar carries fifteen controls, but only seven ideas:
// Navigate, Stream, View, Control, Simulate, Inspect, Capture. When the
// row will not fit, a WHOLE cluster folds into one menu button — never
// an item, never a partial group. A flat per-control priority queue was
// tried first and tore Shake off Home on a tie-break between equal
// ranks; see docs/mockups/focus-toolbar-overflow.html, which runs both.
//
// This class owns no DOM. The caller hands it a `fits` callback that
// renders a candidate state and reports whether the row fits; it hands
// back the first state that did. That split is the point — the
// arithmetic is unit-tested here and the rendering stays
// integration-only, same bar as sim-native.js itself.
//
//   const fold = new ToolbarFold(CLUSTERS);
//   const plan = fold.plan((state) => {
//     paint(state);                                   // your DOM
//     return bar.scrollWidth <= bar.clientWidth + 1;  // your measure
//   });
//   plan  // → { folded: ['simulate'], merged: false, tight: false }
//
// Re-measuring after every candidate is deliberate: there is no width
// table to keep in sync with the CSS, and it stays right when a device
// name is long or a webfont lands late.

     *   2. …each cluster folded in turn, down the fold order
     *   3. every folded cluster merged into one menu — a LAST RESORT,
     *      not a threshold. Separate cluster buttons keep their
     *      meaning (you can go straight to Simulate), so they survive

     *      its own menu, so merging it would swap a named button for
     *      an anonymous one and save nothing.
     *   4. the device name truncates. Everything above either vanishes
     *      into a menu or is pinned; the name is the only control that
     *      can survive at a smaller size, which makes it the cheapest
     *      thing left to give — and the last.
