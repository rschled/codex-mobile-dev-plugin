// PluginPrompt — what a panel's text field means.
//
// Every panel before this one was a report: the host ran a command and
// drew what came back. A deep-link bar can't work that way, because the
// interesting value is the one nobody has typed yet. A panel may declare
// a `prompt`, and submitting it invokes that panel's own `source`
// command with the typed text under the key the manifest named:
//
//   "prompt": { "arg": "url", "placeholder": "myapp://path",
//               "submit": "Open", "filter": true }
//
// which posts `{"args":{"url":"<typed>"}}` — the same body a
// `rowAction: "run"` click posts, to the same endpoint. So this is a
// widget, not a new execution model, and no plugin code runs in the page.
//
// Split out of sim-plugins.js so the decisions are testable without a
// DOM, exactly as plugin-row-action.js is: this file says what should
// happen, sim-plugins.js does it.
